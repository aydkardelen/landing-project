# landing-project

This is the second project in the cirriculum of The Odin Project. I've used all my knowledge of html and css in the proccess.
I've learned the foundations of CSS: how to use class and id attributes and add styles to specific elements using the correct selectors; also learned about the cascade and how to use it properly. Also the box model, block-and-inline and finally, flexbox.
